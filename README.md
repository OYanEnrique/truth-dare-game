# ðŸ˜ˆ Truth or Dare Game

A fun and simple command-line version of the classic "Truth or Dare" game, written in Python.

## Features

* **Random Questions & Dares**: The game randomly selects from a predefined list of truths and dares, so each round is a surprise.
* **Interactive Gameplay**: A simple loop allows for continuous play with friends.
* **Countdown Timer**: A 60-second timer starts automatically after each truth or dare is given, adding to the challenge.
* **User-Controlled**: Players can choose to continue playing or end the game after each round.

## How to Play

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `truth_dare.py`).
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python truth_dare.py
    ```
4.  When prompted, type `t` for Truth or `d` for Dare.
5.  The game will present you with a random question or challenge, and a 60-second countdown will begin.
6.  After the timer runs out, you will be asked if you want to continue. Enter `Y` for yes or `N` to end the game.
